- _Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly, for example by filing a public issue._
- _Do not test the vulnerability on a publicly available network, either the testnet or the mainnet._

If you believe that you have found a significant bug or vulnerability, please report it to dev@gud.dev.

### Rights of maintainers
Alongside this policy, maintainers also reserve the right to:
